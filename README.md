## Beerarchy
### Prologue
Anarchy, chaos, griefing. All is allowed on this unmoderated server. Venture into the depths of hell or ascend the highest mountains, leaping from float land to float land all the way into space. You will be rewarded for your efforts, as endless riches can be found in the most inaccessible places. But be careful who you trust or you will lose everything and be forced to start all over.

So keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Hide your base well, conquer the lands, climb the rankings, become the number one and God of this world.

### Act One
You are approached by a dark figure. Something is amiss. It is not whole, missing an eye, radiating darkness. Its eye, shimmering in the starlight, stares straight into your being, burning your soul, turning your heart into brimstone and ashes, and with a voice of 6000 years old it starts to speak: "I offer you a choice: Live your boring life and achieve nothing, or be teleported to Beerarchy to start over and get a chance to gain unfathomable riches and eternal fame. Rot away like a feeble cowardly dog, or defile the gods, conquer their thrones and become the lord master of these desolate lands."

You are blinded by the promise of countless bars of gold, endless amounts of diamonds and eternal supplies of mithril, blinded by the promise of immortality, everlasting glory and lordship over a world. You do not need to think about this decision. You make it. You grasp it with your greedy hands.

A you awaken, you find yourself in a scorching desert. There is nothing but sand and you are stripped of what little Eartly belongings you had. Recalling the dark figure's words, "Start over", "Get a chance", you realize all too well that such words should have been taken literally. There is no way back, but now you are more determined than ever. You clench your fists, ready to take on this world, and as you look at the Sun approaching the horizon, you discern some ungodly shapes slowly moving towards you ...

### Game Principles
* It's based on "vanilla Minetest": It looks and feels a lot like the out of the box default Minetest game, but it becomes more alien when you mine very deep or climb really high
* Offer a difficult and more challenging game: Food is severely limited by tweaking the noise parameters, decreasing the chance of animals spawning and even the apple tree schematic has been modified to produce fewer apples in order to achieve this goal
* Allow players to progress: This is done by means of a ranking system that gives players points for certain activities such as digging, building, traveling etc.
* Provide a tech tree: The tech tree requires players to mine, climb and explore in order to unlock new technologies such as small electronics, travelnets, basic machines and digtrons, but also such things as better armor for more dangerous realms
* Full use of horizontal and vertical space: Keep mining interesting by providing goals in the form of underworlds. Huge mountains and plenty of float lands to hide your base and be safe from other players
* Reward players but keep it hard: By mining deeper or climbing higher, players are rewarded by easier to get to minerals in larger and larger amounts but also face dangers such as death falls and more powerful mobs
* Let Beerarchy be a dangerous place: The seed was specifically selected for the desert spawn, but the places that offer more riches are more dangerous too and not just because of the mobs, but also the terrain, caves and super high mountains
